##   How to Use

This bot can be used in both group chats and private chats on WhatsApp. Here's how to activate and use it:

1.  **Activation/Deactivation:**

    * To **activate** the AI functionality in a chat, send the message: `.toggle`
    * To **deactivate** the AI functionality, send the message: `.toggle` again.

2.  **User ID Management:**

    * When you use `.toggle` for the first time, your WhatsApp user/group ID will be added to a file named `list.json`. This file keeps track of users who have activated the AI.
    * The bot will only respond to AI commands from users/groups whose IDs are present in `list.json` and when the AI is active (toggled on).

3.  **Using AI Features:**

    * Once the AI is activated (and your ID is in `list.json`), you can use the features listed above by sending the corresponding commands. For example:
        * `jadwal mata pelajaran`
        * `image generator <your prompt>` (e.g., `image generator a cat playing piano`)
        * `note <your note>` (e.g., `note Remember to buy groceries`)
